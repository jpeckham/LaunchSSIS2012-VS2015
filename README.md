# LaunchSSIS2012-VS2015
Launch ssis from VB.net code using sql 2012 and VS 2015

## Primary goals
- Use SQL 2012 with SSIS (Special needs, SP 2 CU1-6+SEC 1)
- VS 2015
- Visual Basic
- Launch SSIS package from file locally
- Windows 7 Enterprise

## Other thoughts
### Does SSIS have to be 2012?
We're connecting remotely to a sql 2012 server. Seems like we could use whatever SSIS we wanted locally.

## Environment Setup
* Setup new VM 4 gigs ram, 4 CPU
* Install Win 7 Enterprise SP 1
* Install SQL 2012 SP2 Developer Edition
* Install VS 2015
  - Git
